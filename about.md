I am a Ruby on Rails developer, a gamer, and a have the hunger to learn. I graduated from the Iron Yard Academy in Washington, DC. Built a custom Hackintosh that can boot into Windows and Mac OSX. My addiction is technology and how it's slowly changing the way humans live. My go to text editor is Sublime Text, with spotify playing my favorite non vocal music while I zone out and build. My goal is to build amazing things, problem solve my daily lunch cravings and not turn into a hipster.
